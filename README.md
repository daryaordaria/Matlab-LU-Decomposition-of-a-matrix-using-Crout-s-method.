# Matlab-LU-Decomposition-of-a-matrix-using-Crout-s-method.
The task is to write a computer program to implement the LU-decomposition of a matrix using Crout’s method.

The program consists of two functions: CroutMain and CroutLin.
Function CroutMain(A,n) decompose the square matrix of any size into product of a Lower-triangular matrix [L] and an Upper-triangular matrix [U] using Crout’s Method.
Function CroutLin(L,U,f,n) solve systems of linear equation using Crout’s method.
